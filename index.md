# Hi, I'm Don Hogan

**Technical Product Manager** with a passion for solving complex problems and building products that matter.

I bridge the gap between technical teams and business goals, turning ideas into shipped products. When I'm not managing roadmaps, I'm tinkering with side projects and writing about what I learn.
