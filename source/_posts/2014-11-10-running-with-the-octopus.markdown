# Octopus Runs 10 Minute Mile
I can see the headline now. An octopus. Running. It doesn't matter what its time is in the mile, only that it found 4 pairs of shoes.

All that aside, I'm trying something new. I used to have an old blog on Posterous called **Bolted Down Fun**. I had been doing a tiny bit of bloggin on my site through bluemix but was in need of a more permanent solution. Hence the octopus.

I'm going with Github pages and using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) for my blog proper. Once I figure out more details I'll approriate it to my own needs.

Until then, watch out for the Octopus. Running.
